#    This is an example input file for the Random Walk Simulator application provided with the 
#    Stochastic Migration project.

#    All lines preceded by the '#' character are interpreted as comments.
#    Each line must contain only a single parameter/value pair, separated by a ':' character.

# REQUIRED PARAMETERS
#
# These parameters must be specified for the application to be executed.
#
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

# Set the name for the case.
# The value of this parameter is interpreted as a string. This case must already exist in the 
# database. To populate a new case, use the Database Generator application.
CASE                :

# Set the absolute path to the database.
# The database must already exist. It can be created and populated using the Database Generator
# application.
DB                  :

# Set the size of the Monte Carlo population.
# This parameter sets the number of Monte Carlo trials to execute.
MCPOP               :

# Set the perturber density.
# This parameter sets the density of perturbers in the vicinity of the perturbed body. The
# perturber density is translated to a set of perturbers randomly selected within the semi-major 
# axis bounds, either side of the perturbed body's nominal semi-major axis, as used in the test 
# particle simulations. 
# The perturbed density is expressed in terms of the perturbed body's Hill radius. Note that this
# density can be fractional.
# UNIT              : # of perturbers per R_Hill
RHOPERTURBER        : 

# Set the perturber ring mass.
# This parameter sets the total perturber ring mass in the vicinity of the perturbed body. This 
# total ring mass is translated into a equal mass per perturber, with the perturbers in the ring
# being distributed based on the the density specified by RHOPERTURBER. The total perturber ring
# mass is expressed in terms of the perturbed body's mass.
# UNIT              : M_PERTURBED
MPERTURBERRING      :

#
# OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
#
# If these parameter are not uncommented and given specified values, default values are assumed.
# DO NOT uncomment the UNIT lines; they are simply comment lines.

# Set the number of parallel threads to run the application on.
# This parameters sets the number of parallel threads to spawn using OpenMP, to run the 
# application. The random walk simulations are parallelized over the number of threads specified.
# By default, the application runs on a single thread.
# THREADS             : 1

# Set the output mode for the simulations.
# This parameter sets whether the output should be stored in the database or written to file.
# By default, output is written to the database. To switch this to file, simply pass the parameter
# as "file" (without quotation marks).
# OUTPUT              : database

# Set the file output directory.
# This parameter should only be set in case the OUTPUT parameter is set to "file". The parameter 
# will be ignored if OUTPUT is set to "database".
# With this parameter, the absolute path to the output directory can be specified, where the output  
# files generated are stored.
# The default directory for the output files is the root directory of the Stochastic Migration
# project.
# FILEOUTPUTDIR       : rootdir
