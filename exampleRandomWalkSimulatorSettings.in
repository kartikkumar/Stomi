#    This is an example input file for the Random Walk Simulator application provided with the 
#    Stochastic Migration project. 
#
#    All lines preceded by the '#' character are interpreted as comments.
#    Each line must contain only a single parameter/value pair, separated by a ':' character.

#
# REQUIRED PARAMETERS
#
# These parameters must be specified for the application to be executed.
#
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

# Set the name for the random walk simulation case.
# The value of this parameter is interpreted as a string. This case must already exist in the 
# database. To populate a new case, use the Random Walk Database Generator application.
CASE                : circular_equatorial_heavy

# Set the absolute path to the database.
# The database must already exist. It can be created and populated using the Database Generator
# application.
DB                  : /Users/kartikkumar/Desktop/testDatabase.sqlite

#
# OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
#
# If these parameter are not uncommented and given specified values, default values are assumed.
# DO NOT uncomment the UNIT lines; they are simply comment lines.
#
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

# Set the number of parallel threads to run the application on.
# This parameters sets the number of parallel threads to spawn using OpenMP, to run the 
# application. The random walk Monte Carlo simulations are parallelized over the number of threads 
# specified.
# By default, the application runs on a single thread.
# THREADS             : 1

# Set the output mode for the simulations.
# This parameter sets whether the output should be stored in the database or written to file.
# By default, output is written to the database. To switch this to file, simply pass the parameter
# as "file" (without quotation marks).
OUTPUT              : file

# Set the file output directory.
# This parameter should only be set in case the OUTPUT parameter is set to "file". The parameter 
# will be ignored if OUTPUT is set to "database".
# With this parameter, the absolute path to the output directory can be specified, where the output  
# files generated are stored.
# The default directory for the output files is the root directory of the Stochastic Migration
# project.
