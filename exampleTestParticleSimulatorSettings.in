#    This is an example input file for the Test Particle Simulator application provided with the 
#    Stochastic Migration project. 
#
#    All lines preceded by the '#' character are interpreted as comments.
#    Each line must contain only a single parameter/value pair, separated by a ':' character.

# REQUIRED PARAMETERS
#
# These parameters must be specified for the application to be executed.
#
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

# Set the name for the case.
# The value of this parameter is interpreted as a string. This case must already exist in the 
# database. To populate a new case, use the Database Generator application.
CASE                : 

# Set the absolute path to the database.
# The database must already exist. It can be created and populated using the Database Generator
# application.

#
# OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
#
# If these parameter are not uncommented and given specified values, default values are assumed.
# DO NOT uncomment the DEFAULT and UNIT lines; they are simply comment lines.
#
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

# Set the number of parallel threads to run the application on.
# This parameters sets the number of parallel threads to spawn using OpenMP, to run the 
# application. The test particle simulations are parallelized over the number of threads specified.
# By default, the application runs on a single thread.
# THREADS             : 1

# Set the output mode for the simulations.
# This parameter sets whether the output should be stored in the database or written to file.
# By default, output is written to the database. To switch this to file, simply pass the parameter
# as "file" (without quotation marks).
# OUTPUT              : database

# Set the file output directory.
# This parameter should only be set in case the OUTPUT parameter is set to "file". The parameter 
# will be ignored if OUTPUT is set to "database".
# With this parameter, the absolute path to the output directory can be specified, where the output  
# files generated are stored.
# The default directory for the output files is the root directory of the Stochastic Migration
# project.
# FILEOUTPUTDIR       : rootdir

# Set the output interval.
# This parameter should only be set in case the OUTPUT parameter is set to "file". The parameter 
# will be ignored if OUTPUT is set to "database".
# With this parameter, the output intervals giving the spacing of the data written to file can be
# specified. 
# The default for the output interval is 3600.0 s.
# UNIT: s
# TOUTPUT             : 3600.0

# Set the simulations to execute.
# This parameter sets the simulations to execute, based on the simulation IDs in the input table in
# the database. To list multiple simulation IDs, simply list the numbers, separated by spaces. An
# example of a list of simulation numbers is provided.
# The default setting is to run all incomplete simulations extracted from the database.
# SIMULATIONS         : 1 4 9

# Set the database table names.
# The following parameters can be used to override the default names for the test particle tables
# in the database. For descriptions of these tables, take a look at the 
# "exampleDatabaseGeneratorSettings.in" input file. Uncomment any of these parameters to override
# the default table names.
# TPCASE              : test_particle_case
# TPINPUT             : test_particle_input
# TPKICk              : test_particle_kick

# Override case data.
# The following settings can be used to overwrite the test particle case parameters stored in the 
# database. Descriptions of these parameters can be found in the 
# "exampleDatabaseGeneratorSettings.in" input file.
# By default, the values of the parameters are extracted from the test particle case table in the
# database. By uncommenting any of these parameters, individual case settings can be overriden.
