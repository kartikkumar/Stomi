# It is important to note that the J2 coefficient is not normalized.

# Set the distances used for detection of conjunction and opposition events.
# These parameters set the distances used in the algorithm in the Test Particle Simulator to detect
# conjunction and opposition events of the test particle with the perturbed body.
# The default values of these parameters are 25% and 75% respectively of the maximum distance 
# distance between the test particle and the perturbed body, which is approximately twice the
# semi-major axis of the perturbed body's orbit. The assumption here is that SMALIMIT << SMA0
# and that INC0 is small.
# This default values of these parameters have been obtained through experimentation, thus it might 
# be prudent to play around with the values for difference simulation scenarios.

# Set the parameters of the distibution of initial eccentricities for the test particles.
# The following parameters describe the normal distributions of the orthogonal components of
# the eccentricity vectors that the test particles are seeded with: mu = mean, sigma = standard
# deviation. The joint probability distribution of two orthogonal vector components 
# that are normally distributed yields a Rayleigh distribution of the magnitude of the 
# eccentricity vectors and a uniform distribution of the associated angles, i.e., the argument of 
# periapsis.

# Set the numerical integrator and its parameters.
# The following parameters set the numerical integrator used for the test particle simulations,
# and associated settings.
# The numerical integrator is set to the Dormand-Prince 8(7) scheme by default. The other option
# permitted is the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg 7(8) scheme (RKF78).
# The default value for the initial step size is 60.0 seconds. It might be prudent to play with 
# this starter value for different simulation scenarios.
# The default values for the relative and absolute tolerance for error control are 10^-12 and
# SMA0 * 10^-15 (rounded base) respectively, which are common settings for RKF-type schemes. It 
# might be important to play around with these values for different simulation scenarios.
