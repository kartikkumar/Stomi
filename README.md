StoMi
===================

StoMi is a toolbox that can be used to study stochastic migration procesess in the Solar System. StoMi treats the gravitational N-body problem as a superposition of multiple 3-body problems followed by a random walk.

This toolbox can be used to study the stochastic migration of a massive body, orbiting a central body, due to the gravitational interactions with a ring of low-mass perturbers. 

Possible applications include:
- Studying migration of Neptune due to interactions with the Kuiper belt
- Studying migration of Ceres and Vesta due to interactions with the Main Asteroid belt
- Studying migration of late-stage protoplanets due to scattering interactions with minor bodies
- Studying migration of exoplanets embedded in ring of low-mass bodies 

This toolbox is written iuusing the following open-source libraries:

- Eigen (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)
- Boost (http://www.boost.org)
- Tudat & Tudat Core (http://tudat.tudelft.nl)
- Assist (http://www.github.com/kartikkumar/assist)
